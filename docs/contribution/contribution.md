## __Version Strategy__
When contributing to fits2db, it's important to be aware of our versioning system, which follows semantic versioning principles:

- **Patch Changes (0.0.x):** For small updates that do not introduce new features or significant modifications, such as typo fixes, minor documentation updates, or small bug fixes.
- **Minor Changes (0.x.0):** For more substantial changes that add new features, improvements, or updates that do not break backward compatibility or change the public API.
- **Major Changes (x.0.0):** For major updates that introduce significant changes, such as breaking changes to the public API, large-scale refactors, or when the project reaches a stable production-ready release.

By adhering to this versioning system, we can maintain clarity and predictability for users of our project, helping them understand the impact of each new release.
